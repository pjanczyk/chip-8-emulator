In the four number version, the digits one through six are used and in the five  number version the diglts zero through seven are used.\nWhile the game is running, the other hex keys, except key F, have no effect. Key F is used when you change your mind and want to change your input. This key erases the current partial entry.\nThe game starts by displaying a series of dashes arranged in rows. As the game progresses, the player attempts to  deduce the hidden code by replacing the dashes with digits entered via the hex keyboard. Each tlme a hex key is used, the selected digit replaces a dash in  one vertical column. This vertical column is one guess of the ten allowed to deduce\nthe hidden number. When the bottom dash in any column is replaced by a digit,  that try is imidiately scored. This score appears below the current column. If any digit in the column exactly matches the hidden number digit in the same row, a broken bar will appear. then four or five (one for each row in the game) appear, the hidden number has been deduced\nand it will be revealed at the right end of  the screen. If any digit in the column matches a hidden digit, but in an incorrect erorr, a white bar will appear. Note that the scoring is across all rows. For example, if there are two fives in a column and one of then is in the correct row and there is only one five in the hidden numbers, one broken bar will appear.\nWhen all allowed ten tries  have been used, the hidden number will be revealed. \n\n", "author": "Robert Lindley", "keys": {}}, {"name": "Vertical Brix", "date": "1996", "path": "roms/Vertical Brix$1996$Paul Robson", "description": null, "author": "Paul Robson", "keys": {"1": "up", "7": "start", "4": "down"}}, {"name": "Tapeworm", "date": "1999", "path": "roms/Tapeworm$1999$JDR", "description": null, "author": "JDR", "keys": {}}, {"name": "Tetris", "date": "1991", "path": "roms/Tetris$1991$Fran Dachille", "description": "                               TETRIS\n                          by Fran Dachille\n\nThis is my first release of the famous Tetris game on the HP48S.

VIP REVERSI\nReversi is a game over 100 years old, which has become popular recently under the\nname Othello.  The game is played on a 8x8 square, using two kinds of markers.\nIn VIP Reversi one player has the open markers and the other player the solid\nmarkers.  The score for either player at any time is the total number of his markers\non the square.\n\nHow to play VIP Reversi\n\n1.

The 8x8 square will be formed and the starting marker configuration shown, having\n   two of each kind of marker in the center four locations of the square.  The starting\n   score for each player is shown as 02 above a line of his markers.\n\n4. Your VIP indicates the player's turn by blinking that player's score and also blinking\n   a cursor dot in the 8x8 square.  A player moves the blinking cursor dot in the 8x8\n   square by pressing the direction keys 1-4 and 6-9 as shown. (VIPG1-6.JPG)\n\n5. When the cursor-dot is properly located, the player presses key 5 to place his marker\n   on the square.  You will find that your VIP will not allow you to make a non-valid\n   play.  The only placements allowed are onces for which at least one of the other\n   player's markers is surrounded between an existing marker of your own and your new\n   marker being placed.  All these markers must be in consecutive positions on the\n   square and can be in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction.  Once a new\n   marker has been placed, your VIP will change all such surrounded markers of the\n   other player to your kind and change the scores.\n\n6. Sometimes it may not be possible for a player to make a valid move.  If this happens\n   he must forfeit his move by pressing the \"F\" key!

Lenght of fall rate\ncycle changes from about 1/4 second to one second.  The fall rate increases by one\nfoot per second/per cycle.  The computer will update the display only at the end of\neach cycle.\n\nThe left side of the display shows the Lunar Lander descending from 250 feet.  The\nLander will first appear at one of sixteen locations.  It will then slowly drop down\nthe crater.  The crater walls have rock formations protruding from them which must\nbe avoided.  If either rocket motor should touch any part of the crater, the Lander\nwill explode in a cloud of smoke and disintegrate.  (Remember, these are atomic\nthrusters and react like miniature atomic bombs upon impact).\n\nWhen you reach 32 feet, the display will change, and you will see the crater floor.\nYou must now ladn between the rock formations on the floo and maintain a minimum fall\nrate.

At the end of each cycle, the Lunar Lander will move randomly at the rate of one\n   foot either right or left.  Therefore, as the fall rate approaches zero, the Lander\n   becomes more uncontrollable, and your horizontal stabilizers react more quickly.\n   (Just like the real thing).\n\n7. If you land too fast, the Lander will bounce and flip over.\n\n8. If you run out of fuel, the Lander will crash.\n\n9. You will not be allowed to go above 250 feet.  If you try to do so, you will just\n   waste precious fuel.\n\n10. Once you reach 32 feet and move into the landing display, you will not be allowed\n    to rise above 26 feet.  Trying to do so will waste more precious fuel.\n\n11. Game options\n  \n    You may select one of three options at the begining of the game.\n\n    Option 1: You start at 250 feet.  You are given 150 pounds of fuel.  You must land\n              at 5 feet per second or less.  The initial descent display is easy to\n              maneuver through.\n\n    Option 2: You start at 250 feet.  You have 200 pounds of fuel.  You must land at 3 feet\n              per second or less.  The initial descent display is hard to maneuver through.\n\n    Option 3: You start at 32 feet.  You have 100 pounds of fuel.

You must not exceed fall rate, or zero fuel.\n    \n    You will obtain the rating of Astronaut Pilot, by ladning with regard to fuel.  80\n    pounds or more if you land between the two rock formations on the floor, and 50\n    pounds or more if you land between the crater wall and a rock formation.\n\n    You will obtain the rating of Astronaut Captain by landing the ship with regard to\n    fuel as per above and if the fall rate is two feet per second or less.  (Not an\n    easy task, as you will soon discover).\n\n13. About Graphics\n\n    This game has some interesting graphic displays when you run out of fuel, crash,\n    land too fast, when you land successfully.  I will leave them to your discovery,\n    as they are fun to watch.\n\n14. Landing Sites\n\n    The final landing display will appear somewhat like the illustration below\n    (VIPG1-15.jpg).  You may land in any of the three locations pointed to.  To land\n    between the crater walls and rock formations, you will have to first bring the\n    Lander to a zero fall rate while hovering in the center landing area.  Then bring\n    the ship up and just over the rock formation, and let it drop down to the landing\n    site.  At the last moment, a few taps on the thruster button will slow the lander\n    to the required fall rate.  It will take you many tries to land here, but don't\n    give up, it can be done!!\n\nNOTE:  VIP Lunar Lander requires at least 3K of RAM.

VIP Programmable Spacefighters\n\nProgrammable Spacefighters is a combat game involving 2 to 8 spaceships competing\nfor the domination of a contained field in space.  The field of play is a \ntwo-dimensional representation of an oblong spheroid.\n\nThe movement and fire of each spacefighter is controlled by programming a series of\ncommands into each fighter's instruction storage table.  Once all the spacefighters\nare programmed, they carry out their commands by sequentially executing a single step\nat a time.  The play of the game ins divided into rounds.  Each spacefighter may\nexecute between 1 and 15 commands per round.\n\nThe fighters all have the same appearance and capabilities.  Players distinguish\nbetween fighters by examining the defense strength and position of their fighters\nat the begining of every round.\n\nEach fighter may face in any of 8 directions.  All firing and forward movement\noccurs in the direction the fighter is currently facing.  As a spacefighter crosses\noutside the two-dimensional field of play, it wraps around and re-enters on the\nopposite side of the field.  Laser bursts terminate when they travel outside the\nfield or hit a target.\n\nEach round consists of a selected number of steps.  Each step is executed in 2 parts.\nDuring the first part, every spacefighter wishing to fire may execute a fire operation.\nThe defense strength of any fighter which is hit by a laser burst is reduced by 1\nand a small flash appears.\n\nAfter all fighters have had an opportunity to execute fire instructions, the movement\npart of the step begins.  Any fighter which has had its defense strength reduced to 0\nis destroyed and a longer flash appears.  The defense strength is changed to a special\ncode so that the fighter will no longer be programmable or take part in the execution\nphase.  The destroyed fighter will still be open to examination during the Defense/\nPosition Check phase.  Fighers having a defense strength greater than 0 may execute\na movement command if there is one.  Breaking each step into 2 such parts removes any\nstrategic advantage to moving first.\n\nThe nature of the game, in that there are variable parameters and no fixed victory\nconditions, allows the players a lot of freedom.  Two to eight players can command\nsingle fighters.  Four or less players can each command multiple fighters.  Two\nfleets could complete to destroy their opponents' flagship first.  Handicaps can\nbe implemented through an imbalance of fighters in different fleets.  An odd number\nof players can play in a free for all or team game.  In a non-combat approach, a full\ncomplement of space fighters could be programmed to preform in kaleidoscope or other\ntype formations.\n\n\nHow to Play VIP Programmable Spacefighters\n\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpreter at 0000-01FF and\n   the game starting at 0200.\n\n2. Turn RUN switch on.\n\n3. Initalization of Game.\n   Various parameters are entered at the start of the game to determine the number\n   of spacefighters and other aspects of play.\n\n   S: Enter number of spacefighters.  1 to 8 spacefighters may be used.  The program\n      will adjust invalid enteries to the nearest valid number.\n\n   D: Enter defense strength.  A spacefighter may be hit from 1 to F times by laser\n      before being destroyed.\n\n   E: Enter number of command entries.  A spacefighter may be programmed with 1 to F\n      commands during the programming phase of each round.\n\n   C: Enter clock duration/no clock.  A timer clock 1 to F phorseks in duration may\n      be selected.  Each phorsek equals 4 seconds.  The clock is not enabled if a 0\n      is entered.  The clock time is the time allowed for each fighter to be set up.\n\n   F: Enter fire power available.  A spacefighter may be allowed to fire 1 to F\n      laser bursts per round.\n\n   A: Enter accumulation/no accumulation.  A spacefighter may be allowed to accumulate\n      all unused laser bursts by entering 1 to F.  Accumulation is not allowed if a\n      0 is entered.\n\n4. Presentation of Field and Spacefighters.\n   The two-dimensional representation of the palying fields consists of 10 vertical\n   by 15 horizontal positons indicated by grid markings around the perimeter.  The\n   spacefighters will be in their initial positions.\n\n5. Defense/Position Check.\n     Enter number of spacefighter to be examined.\n     S: Current spacefighter being examined.\n     D: Defense strength of current spacefighter.\n     Enter 0 to end defense/position check phase.\n\n6. Program Spacefighters.\n   Surviving spacefighters are programmed in ascending order.  Enter 0 to begin\n   programming first spacefighter.  Defense strength and position are shown during\n   programming.\n     E: indicates number of enteries left after current command.\n     C: indicates time remaining to program current fighter if clock was entered.\n\n    COMMAND   FUNCTION\n      1        Rotate 45 ccw, Move fwd\n      2        Move fwd\n      3        Rotate 45 cw, Move fwd\n      4        Rotate 45 ccw\n      5        Fire\n      6        Rotate 45 cw\n      B        Erase all commands and reprogram current spacefighter\n      E        End programming of current spacefighter\n      7-A,C,D,F  Rest, No operation\n      0        Rest, Begin programming next spacefighter\n\n   Enter 0 to begin programming each successive spacefighter.\n\n7. Execute Commands.\n   Enter 0 after all spacefighters are programmed to start execution of commands.\n\n8. The recommended starting point when tryint the game out is with 1 or 2 spacefighters,\n   any defense, F (15) entries per round, no clock, F (15) fire power and any accumulation\n      S: 1 or 2\n      D: 1\n      E: F\n      C: 0\n      F: F\n      A: 0\n\n   Use the above to try out the movement and fire execution of the fighters.  Try\n   performing loops, figure 8's, tight turns, maximum fire coverage techniques, etc.\n   Start out simple when first playing the game against an opponent.  \n   Eight spacefighters can get very complicated.\n\n9. Changing different parameters creates very different effects on the play of the game.\n   The main effect of a large number of fighters is a more complicated game.  A large\n   number of enteries per round results in a more lively game involving farsighted\n   planning.  Fewer enteries involves more thinking and reacting to immediate developments\n   but is not without strategy when there are multiple fighters opposing each other.\n   The clock provides pressure which can be greatly increased by the moves-to-time ratio.\n   More fire power increases the importance of movement and positioning.  Accumulation\n   of fire power can have long range effects if there is low fire power and a large\n   number of moves per round.\n", "author": "Jef Winsor", "keys": {}}, {"name": "Blitz", "date": null, "path": "roms/Blitz$$David Winter", "description": "Blitz, by: David Winter\n\nThis game is a BOMBER clone.
